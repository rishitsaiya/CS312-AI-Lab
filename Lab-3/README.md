## Lab-3

Run the script as follows: (run.sh file needs executable permissions: `chmod +x run.sh`)

```bash
./run.sh
```

This will print the output in a new file called `output.txt`.

#### Additional Information:

`4-SAT.py` file is used to produce clauses. It is used in `run.sh`.

`12.py` is the main code which has implementation of algorithms over the input received from `clauses.txt` (produced when `4-SAT.py` was run).
