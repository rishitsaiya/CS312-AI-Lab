# CS 312: Lab 1

The objective of this task is to simulate breadth-first search, depth-first search, and
DFID in the state space. The state-space consists of an m x n grid. The start state
is (0,0). The goal state is the position of (*) in the grid. The Pacman is allowed to
move UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT (except for boundary). A comparison of the path
length and the number of states explored between the different search methods and,
also between the orders in which neighbours are added, are performed.
